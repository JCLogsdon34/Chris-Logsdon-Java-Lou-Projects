Modes:
Production
Training
If you want to implement a different mode for this program, click on the 
configMode.txt file, and type either "training" or "production".
The difference between the two modes is that in Production mode you 
may create, modify, and remove orders, and then save your work.
In training, you may not save your work. No changes or removals will
be saved into the order files. Make sure after you type your choice that you hit save!!!
